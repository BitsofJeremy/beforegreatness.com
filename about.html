                    <br/>
                    <p>Our founder, Jeremy, is not just a fitness enthusiast, but also a beacon of resilience. In 2006, Jeremy was diagnosed with cancer, a battle that he bravely fought and triumphed over. This experience instilled in him a profound appreciation for health and fitness, a passion that fueled the creation of <b>before greatness</b>.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Jeremy's journey through cancer recovery to peak fitness became a source of inspiration for others. He championed the idea that physical fitness is not only about building strength and endurance, but also about overcoming challenges, embracing personal growth, and celebrating the human spirit's indomitable resilience.</p>
